Trees versus Tries
==================

Recall that the Huffman coding tree stored in the left branch all
letters whose codes start with 0, and in the right branch all letters
whose codes start with 1.
We can use this same concept to store records in a search tree that is
slightly different from the behavior of a BST.
We can view all keys stored as appearing on a numberline.
The BST splits the numberline based on the positions of key values as
it receives them.
In contrast, we could split key values based on their binary
reprsentation similar to what the Huffman coding tree does.
The following slideshows present this in more detail.
